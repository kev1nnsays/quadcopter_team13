The bbblib subdirectory contains standalone utilities for handling BeagleBone hardware interfaces.
It is similar to BlackLib but hopefully easier to read and use.  You can use either for your project.

Contents:
- bbb.h, bbb_init.c:  general definitions and initialization/deinit functions
- bbb_adc.c:  A/D conversion functions
- bbb_gpio.c:  GPIO input/output functions
- bbb_pwm.c:  PWM management functions
- bbb_i2c.c:  I2C management functions

Test programs:
- bbb_test_ADC.c:  Reads one A/D channel and prints results to screen
- bbb_test_GPIO.c:  Toggles one GPIO pin for 10 seconds
- bbb_test_PWM.c:  Configures and runs one PWM channel for 10 seconds
- bbb_test_I2C.c:  (UPDATE WILL BE PROVIDED!)  Reads the Adafruit LSM9DS0 IMU
