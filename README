Code Implemented
=====================

New LCM types for debugging -
    -- State machine - lcm_state_t.lcm
    -- PID - pid_state_t.lcm

Data Logging - PID + State Machine

Important Files -
    Quadcopter_main.c :
        - Common functions for PID reset, safety zone checks,etc.
        - Keyboard Input Thread
        - Waypoint Queue
        - Print and Debugging
        - Transmitter Spoofing

    Processing_loop.c :
        - State Machine Logic
        - Handling Set Points

        Command Handler:
- Calls the auto-controller (PID)

    Set_Dynamixel.c:
    - Gripper Command Handler
